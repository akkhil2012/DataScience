 
Quantitative(Continous)
Numeric:
  1. ordinal variables(descrete but with order)
  id refers to neither Quantitative / Qualitative value( as no info derived from id)

  2. Binomial(Dichotomous) : either of quantitaive/qualitative
  Gender : can be binomial but taken as qualiative(Categorical)

Character:
  Categorical
  text
  
TimeSeries: (key,value ) pair as (TimePeriod,Metric(sales)) as (Jan17,$10000)
as the stock prices change per hour/day/week/month i.e. forecasting

Metadata : Like properties associated with the file as File Creation date

UnStructuredData:
  
SemiStructured data : as HTML template with data, Network Logs

############# Mesure of central tendancy ###########
Descriptive Statistis:
  mean  : Subject to outlier as movie for ages 8.6.6.10.85 OR salary average inclusing emplyee+ceo
  meadian




Median is prefered against mean
 1,2,3,470, 200000( mean outlier )
 
 
 
 
Normal Distributon: If histogram is symmetric across mean


Ideally the bin size(partitions) should be small/at least 10 for peoper distribution interpretation
( bin is the range as 2 lakhs for salaries hence, Histogram)
as when using large bin size, distribution gets lost
In real time its mostly skewed(left/right)


right skewed: When mean > median
since for example salary of the CEO i.e. too high but of extreme right
(outliars on right side)


left skewed: ex: sum total of marks in all 10 subjects < 10 (rare case to happen)
mean < median

Measures of Spread: Variance and Deviation

ex: 28.29.30,31,32 Vs 10,20,30,40,50( both has same mean and median)
but first is prefered as is consistency( lesser the spread better the distribution)


Std. deviation (tell the deviation on average from mean value )= squaerRoot(variance) Virat kohli runs deviation
( Used to Quantify the Spread )

two sources cann't be compared w.r.t. mean unless Standard deviation(spread) is determined
ex: salary comparison of man and woman






############# Sampling ##############################
right representation of sample data is prerequisite
   1. Simple Random Sampling
   2. Systematic Sampling
   3. Stratified Sampling????

underepresntation OR underrepresenttaion while calculating avregae height for indians(Mlea and female as constituing diff. pecentage 
similarly, w,r,t, region as every region might have different weightage in actual total percentage: called Stratification) 
)
wher Men and Woman are called strata as are diierent distribution


Systematic Sampling: eg to sample evena and Odd Numbers Or numbers ending with 9
Vs Random sampling??


In Stratefied Sampling: must satisfy PreRequisite as total count of population
Sample Size????
Worst case sa,mpling: for given numbers frok 1............100
I take sample as 1..........10 than mean sof total is 5 from sample but is wrong
As sample size increases, probability of selecting correct sample increases(graph gets Linear)









































lower the outliers so median and mean are nearally lose



Percentle: 50th percentile is a mean 



1st quartile(25 percentile):
3rd quartile:(75 percentile)?????? WHY 75 Percentile
  
No 2nd quartile??


addition of constant to values won't make median to vary as lot alike when multiplied by same constant

Function derivation for Normal distribution???

mean - 1 and mean +1 area will cover 68% data(  for normal dist.)?????
95% within 2 std deviation
99.7 within 3 standard deviation

6 sigma: related to the petrol pump fuel filling

1 sigma is if  68% falls wihtin 1 sigma if 2the stad. deviation < 68%
  
lesser the std. deviation more is the consistency and hence better is the process.events()  
eg : overdosage vs nderdosage of drug as 5 ml/25ml

Normal distribution == bell curve == Gaussian Distribution

Companies Appraisal bell curve should be : left skewed

z-score??? solved by Standard Normalization:( When all data is NOT on a common scale )
  eg: to analyse students from different boards/ Universities
