## All below is done on continous variables

Null Hypothesis: H^0  mean(boys) == mean(girls) // a conservative approach // as , complain has no effect in growth
Alternate Hypothess : H^a if in 100 samples mean(girl) >> mean(boys) // more optimistc // compain better results than other drinks

T tests
One Smaple :
   One Sided(Brdige strength)
   Two Sided(Petrol Pump)
  
Two Sample:
   One Sided
   Two Sided

   
One Sample: 
  Non Descriptive : ex: pressaure the bridge should bear : Null hypotheses: bridge doen't bear such stregth as 100 units
  ( by taking sample from varipus points )
  Type1: certifying bridge even when stregth is less < 100
  Alternative to Confidence part: by taking multiple sampples(as otherwise could be done)

T Statistics: alie log table to determine the t - test(formula in notebook)

chart determine the TYPE 1 ERROR  for given degree of freedom and observations

1. One sample test Or Two Saple Test
2. wetherone sided/ two side
3. confidence level

Degree Of Freedom: to overcome the two end cases where in the best case: (91 to 100) / worst case(1 to 10) for sample of 1 to 100

the constraint where in its the number of count kept out of control to be choosen and the  sample taken must be such that the
the sum of sample to be > 100
