## For Continous variable 
## To determine quantative relation
Correlation: relation between two continous variables
 +ve correlation : directly propotional(height and weight)/ years of exper. vs salary
 -ve correlation : inversely( car depreciation)
 No Correlation

# Accompalised using Pearson / Correlation Coefficient(r^2)

when between ( -1 to +1) Strong positive Correlation( height and weight)
                         Weak positive Correlation ( Age;l, vs weight)

      Mileage vs Odometer reading( weak negative)
      Car Price Vs Odometer reading( Strong Negative)
      
Causation:
  
Spurious Correlation: can be a bogous Correlation
when the realtion between cause and effect cannot be determined.



### For Descrete Data : Association is used rather than Correlation as for Continous data above
Odds() ratio is used for descrete data( smoker/ cancer example in notebook)

## Corelaion



a = c(1,2,3,4,5)
b = c(11,24,33,49,68)

cor(a,b)  ## Spurious Corellation
